"""Example demonstrating reading of 1 second waveform data (wideband amplifier
data on channel A-010) using TCP command socket to control RHX software and TCP
waveform socket to read amplifier data.

In order to run this example script successfully, the Intan RHX software
should first be started, and through Network -> Remote TCP Control.

Command Output should open a connection at 127.0.0.1, Port 5000.
Status should read "Pending".

Waveform Output (in the Data Output tab) should open a connection at 127.0.0.1,
Port 5001. Status should read "Pending" for the Waveform Port (Spike Port is
unused for this example, and can be left disconnected).

Once these ports are opened, this script can be run to acquire ~1 second of
wideband data from channel A-010, which can then be plotted assuming
"matplotlib" is installed.
